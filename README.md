For multiplayer board games with a Task Master based on quantum operations. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
The board games are such that the users cannot look at the contents of the board at all times. The board remains with the TaskMaster. The players have to calculate the move that their opponent might have taken and plan their moves accordingly. The place to operate on(qubit) is given to a player by their opponent.
